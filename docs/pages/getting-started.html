<h3 class="usa-heading">For developers</h3>

<p>The UI components are built on a solid <strong>HTML</strong> foundation, progressively enhanced to provide core experiences across browsers. All users get critical information and experiences. New browsers get the prettiest experiences, while older browsers get less pretty, but usable ones. If JavaScript fails, users will still get a robust HTML foundation.</p>

<h4>CSS architecture</h4>

<ol class="usa-content-list">
  <li>The CSS foundation of this site is built with the <strong><a href="https://sass-lang.com">Sass</a></strong> preprocessor language.</li>
  <li>Uses <strong><a href="http://bourbon.io/">Bourbon</a></strong> for its simple and lightweight Sass mixin library, and the <strong><a href="http://neat.bourbon.io/">Neat</a></strong> library for the grid framework. Bourbon and Neat are open-source products from <strong><a href="https://thoughtbot.com/">thoughtbot</a></strong>.</li>
  <li>The CSS organization and naming conventions follow <strong><a href="https://pages.18f.gov/frontend/css-coding-styleguide/">18F's CSS Coding Styleguide</a></strong>.</li>
  <li>CSS selectors are <strong>prefixed</strong> with <code>usa</code> (For example: <code>.usa-button</code>).</li>
  <li>Uses a <strong><a href="https://pages.18f.gov/frontend/css-coding-styleguide/naming/">modified BEM</a></strong> approach created by 18F for naming CSS selectors. Objects in CSS are separated by single dashes. Multi-word objects are separated by an underscore (For example: <code>.usa-button-cool_feature-active</code>).</li>
  <li>Uses <strong>modular CSS</strong> for scalable, modular, and flexible code.</li>
  <li>Uses <strong>nesting</strong> when appropriate. Nest minimally with up to two levels of nesting.</li>
  <li><strong>Global variables</strong> are defined in the _variables.scss file. This is where custom theming can be done to change site-wide colors, fonts, etc.</li>
  <li>Hard-coded magic numbers are avoided and, if necessary, defined in the <code>_variables.scss</code> file.</li>
  <li>Media queries are built <strong>mobile first</strong>.</li>
  <li><strong>Spacing units</strong> are as much as possible defined as rem or em units so they scale appropriately with text size. Pixels can be used for detail work and should not exceed 5px (For example: 3px borders).</li>
</ol>

<h4>Where things are:</h4>

<ol class="usa-content-list">
  <li>
    <strong>HTML</strong> markup for the components are located in: 
    <code>
      docs/_visual, 
      docs/_layout-system,  
      docs/_elements, 
      docs/_components
    </code> 
    in the site root.
  </li>
  <li><strong>Sass</strong> styles are located in: <code>dist/stylesheets/_scss (/core, /elements, /components)</code>. <strong>Compiled CSS</strong> is located in: <code>_site/assets/css/<wbr>styleguide.css</code>.</li>
  <li><strong>JS</strong> is located in: <code>dist/js/components.js</code>.</li>
  <li><strong>Fonts</strong> are located in: <code>dist/fonts</code>.</li>
  <li><strong>Images</strong> and icons are located in: <code>dist/img</code>.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Browser support:</h4>

<p>The standards are designed to support both older and newer browsers through progressive enhancement, and officially support Internet Explorer 9 and up, and the latest versions of Chrome, Firefox, and Safari. Internet Explorer 8 and below generally see very low usage today, and most agency websites should be able to safely begin support at Internet Explorer 9.</p>

<h3 class="usa-heading">For designers</h3>

<h4>About the visual style guide</h4>
<p>While many programs maintain their own unique brand identities, this guide offers a single common visual style which can be flexibly applied to a broad range of government digital platforms. The Visual Style Guide on this site offers a <strong>clean, modern aesthetic</strong> that meets <strong>high standards of visual accessibility</strong> while promoting a sense of <strong>credibility, trust, and warmth</strong> in the design.</p>
<p>The color palette and typography were selected to provide both consistency and flexibility. The combination of a sturdy serif and slender sans serif with brighter hues can create a contemporary look and feel. When used alongside softer colors, different font pairings from the set will communicate a more classic and traditional aesthetic. The typography meets a range of layout needs; from polished marketing pages to content-heavy digital services. The palette’s blue, white, and red can be applied generously or sparingly, all in attempt to create a distinctly American design with adaptability baked in.</p>
<p>We fully expect many teams will need to customize this style guide, but we encourage you to incorporate as much consistency in look, feel and usability as possible.</p>
<p>As a complement to this visual style guidance, we strongly recommend you use <a href="https://pages.18f.gov/content-guide/">18F’s Content Guide</a> when writing language for government services.</p>

<h4>UI components and patterns</h4>
<p>The site contains HTML mockups of common UI components designed to follow the Draft Web Design Standards' visual style guide. To view the specs of each design live on this website (padding, margins, stroke weight, line-height, etc.), use your browser’s developer tools.</p>
<p>All of these designs are also available in a variety of design file formats for download:</p>
<ul class="usa-content-list">
  <li><strong>Illustrator, EPS, Sketch, and OmniGraffle</strong> art files of each component and pattern on this site are available at: <a href="{{ site.repos[1].url }}">{{ site.repos[1].url }}</a></li>
  <li><strong>.AI and .ASE color swatches</strong> are available at: <a href="{{ site.repos[1].url }}/tree/master/Colors">{{ site.repos[1].url }}/tree/master/Colors</a></li>
  <li><strong>.TTF files</strong> of the font families and weights we recommend are available at: <a href="{{ site.repos[1].url }}">{{ site.repos[1].url }}</a> (Note: all fonts used in the Draft Web Design Standards are free, open source typefaces also available online).</li>
</ul>
<p>All of the designs meet the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/">WCAG 2.0 AA accessibility guidelines</a> and are compliant with <a href="http://www.section508.gov/">Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act</a>. <strong>If you choose to customize them, ensure they continue to meet the requirements listed in the “Accessibility” section of each design.</strong></p>
